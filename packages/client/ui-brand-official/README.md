English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

This package gives an `official` client build the shared SUNFLECK mark and Phudu vector wordmark in the sidebar. Other profiles keep the shared mark and SUNFLECK text fallback. The conversation hero uses the shared mark without fish morphing. Deployments with another identity can provide a replacement brand package. The package does not affect model requests.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin in the browser roster of a SUNFLECK deployment, then build the client with the `official` profile so the occupants register.

### Choosing the profile

`DSH_CLIENT_BUILD_PROFILE` selects the sidebar presentation. An `official` build shows the shared mark and vector wordmark; other values leave the shared mark and SUNFLECK text fallback in place. The conversation hero uses the shared mark regardless of profile. The plugin loads in both cases; only the sidebar registration is profile-gated.

### Replacing the brand

A deployment with its own identity leaves this package out and composes another package that occupies the sidebar slots — and the hero slot, which this package leaves on its fallback. Occupying a slot is the only composition route; there is no brand configuration surface here.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The two occupants install as one declaration-aware registration set: nested `ctx.slots.inject()` calls wait on the sidebar declaration, so the set works whether this row activates before or after the declarer, withdraws both occupants when the declaration collapses, and leaves no partial brand mix during HMR. The browser half is [`src/client/index.ts`](src/client/index.ts); the node half is an empty Loader seat. The browser title is a build-environment concern (`DSH_CLIENT_TITLE`), outside the slot system.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the brand surface is not enough. They move from the slots this package occupies to the shell that renders them.

- [ui-sidebar](../ui-sidebar/README.md) — declares `sidebar.brand.mark` and `sidebar.brand.name` and renders their fallbacks.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — declares `conversation.hero.brand.mark` in the hero.
- [Web client architecture](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-19-gui-web-client-architecture.md) — how browser plugin rows load and register slots.

## Model Experience

None, as the package contributes browser presentation only; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define how brand presentation is supplied. They are current package constraints, not a brand-design comparison or a task backlog.

- **One occupant set** — alternative presentation belongs in another Cordis package occupying the same slots.
- **The browser title is independent** — `DSH_CLIENT_TITLE` selects title text at build time rather than through a UI slot.

### Dev Note

<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

None.

</details>

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. The package retains no mutable state, and its two sidebar occupants install and leave through one declaration-aware registration set.
